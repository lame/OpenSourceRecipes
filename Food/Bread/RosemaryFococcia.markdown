# Rosemary Focaccia Bread

## Ingredients

- [ ] **1/2 cup (120 ml)** extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] **2 cloves** garlic, finely minced
- [ ] **1 tablespoon** fresh thyme chopped or 1 teaspoon dried
- [ ] **1 tablespoon** fresh rosemary chopped or 1 teaspoon dried
- [ ] **1/4 teaspoon** fresh ground black pepper
- [ ] **1 cup (235 ml)** warm water
- [ ] **2 1/4 teaspoons** active dry yeast (1 packet)
- [ ] **1/4 teaspoon** honey
- [ ] **2 1/2 cups (315 grams)** all-purpose flour
- [ ] **1/2 teaspoon** fine sea salt

## Instructions

**MAKE DOUGH**

- In a cold medium skillet, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, and the black pepper. Place the pan over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes or until aromatic, but before the garlic browns. Set aside.
- In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and honey. Stir a few times then let sit for 5 minutes.
- Add 1 cup of the flour and a 1/4 cup of the infused garlic-olive oil mixture to the bowl with yeast and honey. Stir 3 to 4 times until the flour has moistened. Let sit for another 5 minutes.
- Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. When the dough comes together, transfer to a floured board and knead 10 to 15 times until smooth.
- Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise for 1 hour. (Itâ€™s best to let the dough rise in a warmer area of your kitchen).

**BAKE BREAD**

- After 1 hour, heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Use two tablespoons of the remaining garlic-olive oil mixture to oil a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. (See above if you do not have this pan size).Focaccia-Bread-Recipe-Step-2

- Transfer the dough to the baking sheet then press it down into the pan. Use your fingers to dimple the dough then drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the garlic-olive oil mixture. Let the dough rise for 20 minutes until it puffs slightly.
- Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool baked focaccia bread on a wire rack.
